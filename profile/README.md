### What We Do: Our Core Pillars

We operate at the intersection of laboratory science, epidemiology, and community engagement. Our work is organized into four key pillars:

#### 1. Veterinary Diagnostics & Research
We are the region's primary center for scientific analysis, providing critical services to identify and understand animal diseases.
-    **Diagnostic Testing:** Providing accurate and timely laboratory services for a wide range of livestock, wildlife, and zoonotic diseases.
-   **Farm Health Management:** Providing scientific support and health monitoring for dairy, poultry, beef, and other livestock farms.
-   **Clinical Supply Production:** Producing and distributing essential vaccine reconstitutes (saline water) and distilled water to support regional health campaigns.
-   **Applied Research:** Investigating local veterinary challenges to develop practical, evidence-based solutions.

#### 2. Disease Surveillance & Public Health
We actively protect the health of animals and humans by tracking, investigating, and controlling disease threats.
-   **Active Surveillance:** Conducting surveillance for transboundary, zoonotic, and economically significant diseases.
-   **Rapid Outbreak Response:** Leading investigations of disease outbreaks and providing evidence-based control recommendations.
-   **Vaccination Strategy:** Developing and updating regional vaccination calendars to manage and prevent key livestock diseases.
-   **Strategic Eradication Programs:** Coordinating regional campaigns against major diseases like **Peste des Petits Ruminants (PPR)** and **Rabies**.

#### 3. Data-Driven Epidemiology
We transform raw data into actionable intelligence to guide public policy and field interventions.
-   **National Data Management:** Managing the regional pipeline for the **Monthly Disease Occurrence and Vaccination Activities Report (DOVAR-II)**.
-   **Trend Analysis:** Monitoring and analyzing data from the **National Animal Disease Notification and Investigation System (ADNIS)**.
-   **Geospatial Analysis:** Utilizing GIS to map disease hotspots, predict spread, and optimize resource allocation.

#### 4. Capacity Building & Training
We strengthen the entire veterinary network by equipping front-line professionals with the skills they need to succeed. Our key training programs include:
-   üß™ **Basic Laboratory Techniques:** Foundational skills for district-level laboratory staff.
-   üìä **Basic Animal Health Surveillance:** Methods for effective monitoring and data collection.
-   üîç **Disease Outbreak Investigation & Response:** Practical steps for managing and containing outbreaks.
-   üó∫Ô∏è **Geographic Information System (GIS):** Applying spatial analysis to animal health, from basic to advanced levels.
-   üìã **Ethiopian National Livestock Data Standard:** Ensuring data consistency and interoperability across the network.

### Our Open-Source Roadmap

We are committed to building open-source tools that benefit the entire veterinary community. Our upcoming projects include:
-   **üìà Disease Surveillance Dashboard:** An interactive platform for visualizing regional animal disease data.
-   **üíª Diagnostic Data Toolkit:** A suite of scripts for analyzing and reporting on laboratory data.
-   **üó∫Ô∏è QGIS Plugins for Veterinary Epidemiology:** Custom tools for advanced spatial analysis in animal health.
-   **üìÑ Regional Animal Health Reports:** Publicly accessible, anonymized reports and datasets from our surveillance efforts.
